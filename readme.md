# Responsive Panels

*ResponsivePanels* is a totally free [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) theme with custom header and custom background features based on the [Panels theme](http://www.kettlethemes.co.uk/panels/) but made responsive by using [Bootstrap](http://twbs.github.io/bootstrap/).

It is clean, fast loading and displays a featured image for each post to give a beautifully simple and consistent feel to your website.

You can set this featured image for each post simply by clicking on "Featured image" when editing each post, selecting an image, and then saving the post.

The header is 938 pixels wide by 180 pixels high but should work with other dimensions as well.

The theme is highly customisable, and supports:

- Widgets in two locations (right footer, and left footer columns)
- Custom Menus in 3 locations (Header, Left Footer and Right Footer)
- Custom Backgrounds
- Custom Header Image

You can use this theme and the images supplied for whatever purpose you want - personal sites, paid sites, commercial use etc.

The header images were adapted from photographs taken by Sarah Kettle - feel free to use or modify them however you wish.

The website should all be valid XHTML - and has been tested in multiple browsers.
